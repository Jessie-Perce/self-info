Hi! I'm Jessie. My pronouns are he/him/his, and I am generally unremarkable. I come from a small town called Lisle, NY. You can find it on Google Maps roughly centered between Binghamton, and Ithica, NY. My family is fairly normal, but we do have some interesting hobbies. For example, my parents run a couple pseudo-businesses that really only barely pay for themselves. The two I like to mention are the 'portable' sawmill and maple syrup business. I take interest in both, mostly du to the physical effort involved in the somewhat-menial labor, but it is fun to exert myself towards a goal. Beyond that we don't do much. I took interest computers at an early age, but not to an extent beyond mild fascination. In school I got above average grades, out of school I took up hobbies in an almost cyclical fashion. I would read books, shift into watching anime, then shift to video games, before rounding on books again. I had friends, but never hung out with them outside of school. The friends I had were close friends that often entertained exactly one of my hobbies. Beyond that, I helped my family with thier never-ending list of projects that would improve or fix various aspect of our home and belongings.
